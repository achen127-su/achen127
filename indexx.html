        <h1>Charlie Chen's Biography</h1>
        <p>
            At the age of 12, Charlie had developed a passion for emergency medicine and toxicological studies by studying public ER cases.
            The comprehensive documentation and research shared by Youtuber ChubbyEmu, an emergency room doctor, allowed Charlie and many others
            to explore the connections between quality of life and biochemical changes. She became enamored by the complexities of the human body
            and the influence of seemingly insignificant decisions on the natural world. Because of comprehensive public case access, she found a
            passion that led her onto the path of becoming an emergency room physician.

            Later that year, she developed persisting knee pain, uncovering an unusually severe deformity within her left knee.
            Though the disorder itself was common, her case was particularly severe and required a rarely performed surgery. Trochlear dysplasia
            is a disorder that rarely interferes with life, but in severe cases a trochleoplasty is required. The surgery itself went well,
            but Charlie developed Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome, a nerve condition that effects one in ten women ages 15 to 24 who receive
            major surgery, as per an NIHS study. She was not adequately informed of the risks regarding PoTs prior to surgery. PoTs caused her to lose
            significant mobility and opportunity, leading her to develop a new appreciation for the research side of medicine.

            Because of these experiences, Charlie is currently dedicating to join the medical field with the purpose of bridging the gap between practicing
            physicians and research results in order to provide adequate understandings of surgical risks.
